-New Petz: Beaver. Beaver ia a semi-aquatic rodent. It drops Beaver Fur to create Beaver Oil.
-You can spread beaver oil on your pet skin. In tamagochi mode your pet will be happy,
but the fact of not do it it is not mandatory for it to being sad.
-Now duckies drop Duck Feathers.
-Fix: No brush ducks because they are not pets.
-Now you can brush your pet (dogs/cats) even if not in tamagochi mode.
